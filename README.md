# IoT Dashboard Design with Dash

Sample example to use Dash python framework for IoT Dashboard Design

"Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required. Build on top of Plotly.js, React, and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical python code." ..._from [Dash by plotly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/)_

See more on [Dash Gallery](https://dash.plot.ly/gallery)

**The intention of this excericse is to undersatand communications between the front-end generated by Dash framewotk and the back-end. The heavy lifting is done by Dash framework. Any web application serving GET/POST methods can utilize Dash front-end implementaion.**

## Example 1. Chart Display 

 Started with the first example from [Dash User Guide](https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started), set  interval=3000 (3 secs) and defined [callbacks](https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started-part-2).

</p
 
 `index.html`, `_dash-layout`, `_dash-dependencies` are generated by Dash framework. Use it for Node-RED `template` node. For [live-update](https://dash.plot.ly/live-updates), the back-end responds `_dash-update-component`(react props) request every 3 secs (interval=3000).
